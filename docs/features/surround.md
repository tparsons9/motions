The surround feature brings the power of [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround) (the Lua successor to tpope's vim-surround) to Obsidian. It allows you to add, change, and delete surrounding delimiters like brackets, quotes, and HTML tags. This implementation includes native support for Markdown formatting marks, function wrapping, and custom surround pairs.

> [!info]
> For the best experience, disable Obsidian's built-in Vim mode in **Settings → Editor → Vim key bindings**. This enables the plugin's bundled fork mode, which provides full surround support and Neovim-correct behavior.

## Keybindings

![[keybindings#Surround]]

## Targets

Surround operations work with a wide range of targets.

- **Quotes**: `"`, `'`, `` ` ``
- **Brackets**: `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`
- **Tags**: `t` (HTML tags)
- **Aliases**: `b` for `)`, `B` for `}`, `r` for `]`, `a` for `>`

### Bracket spacing

Opening and closing brackets behave differently regarding whitespace:

- **Opening brackets** (`(`, `[`, `{`): Add a space inside the delimiters.
- **Closing brackets** (`)`, `]`, `}`): Do not add spaces.

## Tag surround

You can wrap text in HTML tags or change existing tags.

- **Add tag**: `ys{motion}t<tagname>` or `ys{motion}<` (triggers a prompt).
- **Change tag**: `cst<newtag>`.
- **Delete tag**: `dst`.

When prompted for a tag, typing `<` allows you to enter the tag name.

## Function surround

The `f` and `F` targets in replacement position allow you to wrap text in a function call.

- **`ysiwf`** + name + Enter: Wraps the target in `functionName()`.
- **`ysiwF`** + name + Enter: Wraps the target in `functionName( )` with internal spacing.
- **`dsf`**: Deletes the surrounding function call, keeping the arguments (`print(hello)` → `hello`).
- **`csf`** + name + Enter: Changes the surrounding function name (`foo(bar)` → `baz(bar)`).

`dsf` and `csf` use `findSurroundingFunction` which scans the current line for `identifier(` patterns. Nested calls, method chains (`obj.method()`), and no-arg functions (`func()`) are supported. Multi-line function calls are not detected (single-line only).

## Markdown text objects as the motion

`ys` accepts every text object the plugin registers, not just the built-in ones — `ysi$b` wraps the contents of `$1 + 1 = 2$` in parentheses, `ysa$b` wraps the whole expression including the `$` delimiters, and the same applies to `i=`, `i~`, `i_`, `` i` ``, `il`, `iC`, `io`, `i,` and the rest. See [[text-objects]] for the full list.

Where a Markdown object shares a key with a built-in one, the Markdown object is tried first and the built-in is the fallback: `ysaB` surrounds the enclosing blockquote inside one, and the enclosing `{}` block elsewhere.

## Count-prefix

Markdown formatting marks use a count-prefix to distinguish between single and double delimiters.

- **Bold**: `2ysiw*` surrounds a word with `**`.
- **Strikethrough**: `2ysiw~` surrounds a word with `~~`.
- **Highlight**: `2ysiw=` surrounds a word with `==`.

To delete these repeated delimiters, use a count with the delete command, such as `2ds*`.

Doubled symmetric delimiters also work with single-character `ds`/`cs` — `ds$` on `$$example$$` deletes the innermost `$` pair to produce `$example$`, and `cs$)` changes it to `$(example)$`. This applies to all symmetric surround characters (`$`, `"`, `'`, `` ` ``, etc.).

> [!tip]
> Use the count-prefix for fast Markdown formatting. It's often quicker than typing the marks manually.

## Newline variants

Several commands allow you to place delimiters on their own lines.

- **`yS`**: Adds surroundings on new lines and indents the content.
- **`ySS`**: Surrounds the current line on new lines.
- **`cS`**: Changes surroundings and moves them to new lines.
- **`gS`**: In visual mode, surrounds the selection on new lines.

## Insert mode

You can add surroundings while typing in insert mode using `<C-G>s{char}`. This inserts the pair and places the cursor inside. Pressing `Esc` leaves the cursor on the last typed character, matching vim-surround's behavior. If no text was typed, the cursor rests on the opening delimiter.

Insert-mode surround supports full dot-repeat: pressing `.` after `i<C-G>s)hello<Esc>` replays `(hello)` at the new cursor position. Counted dot-repeat (`2.`) repeats the typed text inside one set of delimiters (e.g., `(hellohello)`). This exceeds both vim-surround and nvim-surround, where insert-mode surround dot-repeat is broken.

`<C-G>S{char}` is the newline variant — places delimiters on separate lines with indentation.

## Custom surround pairs

Define your own single-character triggers that map to arbitrary delimiters — including multi-character ones like `[[wikilinks]]` or `$$math$$`.

### Lua

```lua
vim.obsidian.surround.set("l", { left = "[[", right = "]]" })
vim.obsidian.surround.set("m", { left = "$$", right = "$$" })

-- Or batch:
vim.obsidian.surround.add({
    { "l", left = "[[", right = "]]" },
    { "m", left = "$$", right = "$$" },
    { "e", left = "\\begin{equation}", right = "\\end{equation}" },
})

-- Remove:
vim.obsidian.surround.del("l")
```

### Vimrc

```vim
surroundmap l [[ ]]
surroundmap m $$ $$
surroundunmap l
```

After registration, all surround operations work with the custom pair:

- `ysiw l` wraps a word → `[[word]]`
- `ds l` deletes surrounding `[[...]]`
- `cs l m` changes `[[...]]` to `$$...$$`
- Visual `S l` wraps the selection

### Overriding the built-in pairs

Any built-in surround character can be rebound. The most common reason is the
opening-bracket forms, which add inner spaces by default:

```lua
-- `ysiw(` wraps as `(word)` instead of `( word )`
vim.obsidian.surround.set("(", { left = "(", right = ")" })

-- Curly quotes instead of straight ones
vim.obsidian.surround.set('"', { left = "\u{201c}", right = "\u{201d}" })
```

Removing the override from your config and reloading restores the built-in.

Three characters carry interactive behaviour that an override replaces:

| Character | Built-in behaviour it replaces                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `t`       | As a target, finds the surrounding HTML/XML tag     |
| `f`       | As a target, finds the surrounding function call    |
| `<`       | As a replacement, prompts for a tag name (`cs"<p>`) |

An alias resolves to its canonical character first, so overriding `)` also
changes `b`, `}` changes `B`, `]` changes `r`, and `>` changes `a`. Overriding
the alias itself (`b`) leaves `)` on the built-in.

> [!warning] Empty delimiters are rejected
> `left` and `right` must both be non-empty. An empty delimiter would disable
> the character rather than rebind it, so registration fails instead.

> [!info] Fork mode required
> Custom surround pairs require the plugin's bundled fork mode. Disable Obsidian's built-in Vim mode in **Settings → Editor → Vim key bindings** for full support.

See [[lua-config#Custom surround pairs]] for the full API reference.

## Dot-repeat

All surround commands support the `.` command — including insert-mode surround (`<C-G>s`). You can repeat your last add, change, delete, or insert-mode surround operation across different parts of your document.

## nvim-surround parity

The surround implementation is verified against [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround) via 74 Neovim golden comparison tests. 54 tests pass, 20 deviations are tracked for future improvement.

**Working features** (verified against nvim-surround):

- All `ds`/`cs`/`ys`/`yss`/visual `S` with quotes, brackets, parens, braces, backticks, angle brackets
- Opening vs closing bracket distinction: `ds(` strips inner spaces, `ds)` preserves them; `ysiw(` adds spaces, `ysiw)` doesn't
- Cursor position after surround-add operations (on the opening delimiter)
- Tag operations: `dst` (delete tag), `cst"` (change tag to quotes)
- Count-prefixed Markdown formatting: `2ysiw*` for bold, `2ds*` to delete
- Dot-repeat for `ys`, `ds`, and visual `S`
- Nested and multiline bracket operations
- Empty content surround (`dsb` on `()`, surround empty lines)
- Aliases: `b`→`)`, `B`→`}`, `r`→`]`, `a`→`>`
- Custom surround pairs via Lua/vimrc
- Arbitrary delimiter characters (`|`, `^`, etc.)

**Known gaps** (tracked as deviations):

- `cst<tag>` / `ysiwtdiv` — tag input via golden test dispatch needs re-verification
- `ds<` semantic difference — fork treats `<` as angle bracket; nvim-surround treats it as tag prompt

See [[known-limitations#Surround nvim-surround parity gaps]] for the full deviation list.
