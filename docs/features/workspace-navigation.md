Vim Motions provides Neovim-style window management that works across all Obsidian views. This includes a global key handler that intercepts keystrokes even when no editor is focused, allowing you to control the entire workspace with your keyboard.

When the optional Neovim RPC backend is active, the editor mappings in this page are generated in Neovim and dispatched to the same Obsidian workspace actions. Counted tab targets such as `3gt`, go-to-definition variants, and lowercase workspace ex commands preserve their counts and arguments across the bridge. The host explicitly owns `<C-o>` and `<C-i>` so the jump list can cross notes despite Neovim using one reused buffer; explicit counts such as `2<C-o>` are forwarded.

## Pane and split navigation

Manage your workspace layout using standard Vim window commands. The plugin supports splitting panes, navigating between them, and closing tabs using the `<C-w>` prefix.

![[keybindings#Workspace navigation]]

The `<C-w>` prefix allows for intuitive movement between splits. Use `<C-w>h`, `<C-w>j`, `<C-w>k`, and `<C-w>l` to move focus to the left, bottom, top, or right pane respectively.

### Pane cycling

- `<C-w>w`: Cycle to the next pane.
- `<C-w>W`: Cycle to the previous pane.
- `<C-w>p`: Focus the previously accessed pane (tracked via leaf ID).

## Alternate file and link navigation

- `<C-^>` / `<C-6>`: Switch between the current file and the alternate (previously edited) file. Matches Neovim's `<C-^>` behavior.
- `<C-]>`: Follow the link under the cursor (alias for `gd`).
- `<C-t>`: Pop from link follow — navigates backward through the jump list.

## Tab navigation

`gt` and `gT` cycle through tabs. `gt` supports a count prefix matching Neovim behavior:

- `gt` — go to the next tab (wraps around)
- `gT` — go to the previous tab
- `Ngt` — go to the Nth tab (e.g., `3gt` goes to the 3rd tab)

Tab numbering only counts main editor area tabs — sidebar panes are excluded. When the count exceeds the number of open tabs, the cursor stays on the current tab.

This works in both editor and non-editor views (graph, canvas, reading view, etc.).

> [!warning] Control-W Conflict
> Obsidian's default **Close current tab** hotkey is bound to `Ctrl+W`. You must unbind it in **Settings → Hotkeys** (search for "Close current tab") for the `<C-w>` prefix commands to work. Once unbound, you can close tabs using `:q`, `:quit`, `<C-w>c`, or `<C-w>q`.

## Go-to-definition

Navigate your notes by following links with Vim commands. These commands use Obsidian's internal link resolver to find the target file.

- `gd`: Follow the link under the cursor in the current pane.
- `gD`: Open the link under the cursor in a new tab.
- `<C-w>gd`: Open the link under the cursor in a horizontal split.
- `<C-w>gD`: Open the link under the cursor in a vertical split.

## Document commands

Vim Motions adds several document-level commands for quick access to Obsidian features:

- `gO`: Open the document outline (symbols).
- `g<C-g>`: Show document statistics (word count, character count).
- `ga`: Show information about the character under the cursor.
- `gm`: Go to the middle of the screen line (horizontal midpoint).
- `go`: Go to the Nth byte offset in the buffer (with count prefix).
- `g8`: Show the UTF-8 hex byte values for the character under the cursor.
- `gF`: Open the file path under the cursor, optionally jumping to a line number suffix (e.g., `file.md:42`).
- `<C-g>`: Show file info — filename, line count, cursor position, and percentage through the file.
- `gp` and `gP`: Paste and move cursor past pasted text.

## Folds

Control Markdown folding with standard Vim fold commands:

- `za`: Toggle the fold at the current line.
- `zc`: Close the fold at the current line.
- `zo`: Open the fold at the current line.
- `zO`, `zC`, `zA`: Functionally equivalent to their non-recursive counterparts in Obsidian's flat heading structure.
- `zM`: Close all folds in the document.
- `zR`: Open all folds in the document.
- `zf{motion}`: Create a manual fold over the motion range (also works in visual mode).
- `zd` / `zD`: Delete the fold at the cursor.
- `zE`: Eliminate all folds in the document.
- `zm`: Fold one more heading level (incrementally folds h1, then h2, etc.).
- `zr`: Fold one less heading level (unfolds the most recently folded level).

### Fold motions

`zj` and `zk` move between foldable regions in the document. `zj` moves to the start of the next foldable region below the cursor; `zk` moves to the end of the previous foldable region above the cursor. Both work with counts (e.g., `3zj` skips to the 3rd fold) and operators (e.g., `dzj` deletes to the next fold).

`[z` and `]z` navigate within the current fold. `[z` jumps to the start of the enclosing foldable region; `]z` jumps to its end. If the cursor is not inside a foldable region, these are no-ops.

### Fold state

`zn` disables folding (opens all folds and prevents new folds from being created). `zN` re-enables folding. `zi` toggles between the two states. Configure via `set foldenable` / `set nofoldenable` in vimrc or `vim.opt.foldenable` in Lua.

`zv` opens just enough folds to make the cursor line visible. `zx` reapplies the current fold level (from `zm`/`zr`) and then reveals the cursor line. `zX` reapplies the fold level without revealing the cursor.

### Recursive fold operations

The uppercase fold commands (`zO`, `zC`, `zA`, `zD`) operate recursively on all folds within the cursor's fold region, while the lowercase variants (`zo`, `zc`, `za`, `zd`) operate on a single fold level.

In addition to heading-level folds, the plugin provides dedicated fold providers for **frontmatter** (`---` blocks) and **callouts** (`> [!type]`), making them foldable via `zc`/`zo`/`za`. Folded regions show descriptive placeholder text: the code language, callout type, or frontmatter field count, each with the folded line count. A folded heading shows only `— N lines`, because a heading fold starts at the end of its heading line, so the title is still on screen beside the placeholder.

When the treesitter bridge is available, heading folds and heading/code placeholder labels use parsed Markdown metadata. Heading ranges include nested subsections but exclude trailing blank lines and the next same-level heading. ATX headings indented by up to three spaces are recognized; heading-like text inside fenced code blocks is not treated as a heading by the plugin's provider. Before the parser is ready, or if it is unavailable, the existing regex fallback remains in use. Frontmatter and callout folding keep their existing precedence and labels.

When **Fold-aware navigation** is enabled (**Settings → Vim Motions → Fold-aware navigation**, on by default), jumping into a folded section with a categorized motion automatically unfolds it, matching Neovim's `foldopen` option. Plain vertical motions such as `j` and `k` leave folds closed — exactly as in Neovim. The default categories are `block,hor,mark,percent,search,undo`, which means structural motions (`]h`, `{`, `}`), horizontal motions (`w`, `f`, `$`), mark jumps (`'a`, `` `a ``), `%`, search (`n`, `/`), and undo/redo all trigger auto-unfold. Use `set foldopen=…` (alias `set fdo=…`) in your vimrc or Lua config for fine-grained control — for example, `set foldopen=all` to unfold on every motion, or `set foldopen=block,search` to unfold only on structural and search motions.

When **Fold persistence** is enabled (**Settings → Vim Motions → Fold persistence**), fold state is remembered across file switches and sessions. Folds are restored when re-opening a previously folded file.

> [!info] Neovim RPC ownership
> With the Neovim RPC backend connected, Neovim owns fold commands and fold state. The existing redraw provider mirrors visible `foldclosed()` ranges into CM6, so both render the same folds without replaying commands in two engines. Markdown headings, callouts, and frontmatter are supplied by a window-local `foldexpr`; `zf{motion}` remains Neovim's native operator. Cross-session fold persistence is unavailable in RPC mode because persisted CM6 offsets cannot restore Neovim-owned state safely.

The viewport automatically scrolls to keep the cursor visible after any fold or unfold operation, including Obsidian's **Toggle fold properties** command. The scroll is scoped to actual fold state changes (`is-collapsed` class toggle) — class mutations from third-party plugins (e.g., Meta Bind input fields in the properties panel) do not trigger unwanted scroll jumps.

When **Fold column** is enabled (`set foldcolumn` or **Settings → Vim Motions → Vim features → Fold column**), fold indicators appear in the gutter: `▸` for foldable regions and `▾` for folded regions. Clicking an indicator toggles the fold.

Clicking Obsidian's native fold gutter or the plugin's fold column to unfold a region always works — the plugin includes an unfold range normalizer that corrects mismatched `unfoldEffect` ranges from any source, ensuring unfolds succeed even when the dispatched range doesn't exactly match the stored fold decoration.

## Non-editor view support

The global key handler extends Vim control to non-editor views like PDFs, the graph view, canvas, and the file explorer.

> [!info] Global Key Handler
> When no editor is focused, the global key handler intercepts workspace-relevant keystrokes. If an editor is focused, events propagate to the Vim engine normally.

### File Explorer navigation

When Obsidian's native File Explorer is active, unmodified `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` reuse its arrow-key navigation:

- `h`: Select the parent folder, or collapse the selected folder.
- `j`: Select the next visible file or folder.
- `k`: Select the previous visible file or folder.
- `l`: Expand the selected folder, or enter its first child.

Prefix a movement with a count to repeat it, for example `3j` moves three visible rows. Counts above 100 are capped at 100 movements so a large prefix cannot freeze the interface.

These keys are enabled by **Settings → Vim Motions → Workspace navigation**, which registers them alongside the other global bindings. They operate after the File Explorer receives focus or a pointer interaction, even when Obsidian sends the keyboard event to the document body. Clicking outside the explorer clears that context. They do not run while renaming a file or folder, while another input or contenteditable control is focused, during composition, with a modifier key, or during a pending chord such as `<C-w>h`. The translated arrow event stays in the File Explorer's document, so the same native behavior works in Obsidian windows without reimplementing its tree logic.

### Scrolling

You can scroll a whitelisted view using standard Vim keys:

- `j` and `k`: Scroll down or up by a few lines.
- `gg` and `G`: Jump to the top or bottom of the view.
- `Ctrl-u` and `Ctrl-d`: Scroll up or down by half a page.
- `Ctrl-b` and `Ctrl-f`: Scroll up or down by a full page.

These keys act on the view that currently has focus, and only when its type is whitelisted — see [[workspace-navigation#Customizing the view type whitelist|the view type whitelist]]. Focusing a sidebar pane that is not whitelisted, such as search, tag, outline or backlinks, leaves these keys to Obsidian rather than applying them to the note behind the pane. The File Explorer is the exception described above: it is not whitelisted, but `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` navigate its tree.

> [!warning] Scrolling Hotkey Conflicts
> Obsidian's default hotkeys for `Ctrl-d` (delete paragraph), `Ctrl-f` (search), and `Ctrl-b` (toggle bold/sidebar) intercept these keys before the plugin can see them. To use these for scrolling, you must unbind the conflicting hotkeys in **Settings → Hotkeys**.

### Standalone Ex Command Line

Pressing `:` in a non-editor view opens a standalone command modal. This modal supports globally-safe Ex commands like `:q`, `:wq`, `:e`, and `:sp`.

![[keybindings#Non-editor view bindings]]

## Customizing global bindings

Global mappings can be customized via `.obsidian.init.lua` or `.obsidian.vimrc`. These commands define, override, or remove key bindings that work outside the editor. The File Explorer `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` keys are ordinary entries in the same registry, so they can be remapped or removed like any other global binding — `gmap h :obcommand app:go-back` replaces the explorer `h`. Because `j` and `k` are the same entries that scroll elsewhere, remapping one replaces both meanings.

```lua
-- Add a new binding in Lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>f", ":obcommand switcher:open", { desc = "Open file" })
```

```vim
" Or via vimrc:
gmap <leader>f :obcommand switcher:open

" Override a default binding
gmap H :obcommand app:go-back

" Remove a default binding entirely
gunmap L
```

The right-hand side supports `:obcommand <id>` for Obsidian commands and `:<ex-command>` for global ex commands (`:sidebar`, `:split`, `:grep`, etc.).

Use `:gmap` in the ex command line to list all active global bindings with their source (default or user).

The non-editor which-key overlay shows available completions when a partial key sequence is pending (e.g., pressing `<C-w>` shows all window commands). Label your bindings with the `desc` option in Lua or `gwhichkeylabel` and `gwhichkeygroup` in vimrc. See [[lua-config]] or [[vimrc#Global key mappings]] for full syntax.

## Plugin view compatibility

When a plugin view (such as Spaced Repetition flashcard review, Excalidraw, or any third-party plugin leaf) is active, Vim Motions automatically passes most keystrokes through to the plugin. Only structural navigation keys are intercepted:

| Keys               | Behavior in plugin views      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `<C-w>h/j/k/l`     | Navigate between panes        |
| `<C-w>v`, `<C-w>s` | Split vertically/horizontally |
| `<C-w>c`, `<C-w>q` | Close tab                     |
| `gt`, `gT`         | Next/previous tab             |
| `<C-o>`, `<C-i>`   | History back/forward          |
| `:`                | Open command line             |

Keys like `j`, `k`, `1`–`9`, `H`, `L`, and scroll commands pass through to plugin views, allowing each plugin to handle them natively. The native File Explorer is the deliberate exception: when workspace navigation is enabled, `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` translate to the view's own arrow-key behavior.

### Customizing the view type whitelist

By default, content-interaction keys (scrolling, count prefix, tab shortcuts) are intercepted in these view types: `markdown`, `graph`, `pdf`, `canvas`, `empty`, `image`, `bases`. All other view types are treated as plugin views.

Override this in **Settings → Vim Motions → Workspace navigation view types** or via vimrc/Lua:

```vim
set workspacenavviewtypes=markdown,graph,pdf,canvas,empty,image,bases,excalidraw
```

```lua
vim.opt.workspacenavviewtypes = "markdown,graph,pdf,canvas,empty,image,bases,excalidraw"
```

## Configuration

Workspace navigation is enabled by default. You can toggle it or configure it through the following methods:

- **Settings**: Toggle via **Settings → Vim Motions → Workspace navigation**.
- **Lua**: Add `vim.opt.workspacenav = true` to your `.obsidian.init.lua`.
- **Vimrc**: Add `set workspacenav` to your `.obsidian.vimrc`.

See [[known-limitations#Workspace & hint mode]] for detailed technical limitations.
