Hint mode provides Vimium-style keyboard navigation for the entire Obsidian interface. When activated, the plugin identifies clickable elements in the viewport and overlays them with unique character labels. Typing a label triggers an action on the corresponding element, such as clicking a button, focusing a pane, or navigating a link.

## Non-editor view actions

When a non-editor view is focused (such as the Graph view, a PDF, Canvas, or the File Explorer), the following bindings are available:

| Key  | Action       | Behavior                                                                                    |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `f`  | Activate     | Click buttons, focus panes, navigate links, or focus inputs.                                |
| `F`  | Open new     | Open a link, pane, or file explorer item in a new tab. Uses Ctrl+click for generic targets. |
| `yf` | Yank         | Copy the URL for links, the note path for tabs, or display text for other elements.         |
| `df` | Close        | Close the targeted tab or pane.                                                             |
| `gf` | Context menu | Open the right-click context menu on the targeted element.                                  |

### Count support

Hint actions support count prefixes. For example, `3f` allows you to activate three targets sequentially, with the hint overlay re-appearing after each selection. Similarly, `3yf` yanks three URLs in succession. When using a count with `F` (e.g., `2F`), each target opens in a new background tab while focus stays on the original view, allowing you to continue selecting labels for the remaining count.

## Editor context

In the Markdown editor, hint mode is triggered via `<leader><leader>h` or a configured global hotkey.

- **Activate**: Type the label to click or focus the target.
- **Open in new pane**: Hold `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (macOS) while typing the final character of the label.
- **Context menu**: Hold `Shift` while typing the final character of the label to open the right-click context menu on the target.

> [!note]
> Yank (`yf`) and close (`df`) actions are not mapped to editor key sequences to avoid conflicts with native Vim operators. Use the [Obsidian commands](#obsidian-commands) to trigger these actions from the editor.

## Target types

The plugin classifies targets during discovery to ensure context-appropriate behavior:

- **Panes**: Workspace leaf content. Activating (`f`) focuses the pane. Opening new (`F`) duplicates the pane into a new tab.
- **Tabs**: Workspace tab headers. Can be closed via `df`.
- **Links**: Wikilinks, Markdown links, and external URLs. Opened via Obsidian's internal link resolver.
- **Inputs**: Text fields, textareas, and dropdowns. Activating focuses the element.
- **Buttons**: UI buttons and clickable icons.
- **Generic**: Any other clickable element identified by the plugin.

Smart label assignment prioritizes the home row. Single-character labels are used when few targets are visible, while two-character labels are generated for denser views.

## Keyboard behavior

- **Filtering**: Only visible elements within the current scroll container are labeled.
- **Correction**: Press `Backspace` to reset the first character of a two-character label if you mistype.
- **Cancellation**: Press `Escape` to exit hint mode without taking action. In embedded editors (textarea vim overlays, Oil explorer, table cell editors), Escape only dismisses the hint overlay — it does not exit the embedded editor.
- **Modifier keys**: Pressing `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`, or `Meta` alone does not dismiss the overlay. These keys are ignored until a label character is typed. Hold `Ctrl`/`Cmd` while typing the final label character to open in a new tab. Hold `Shift` to open the context menu instead.
- **Modal interaction**: Hint mode remains active in modals, allowing you to navigate settings or the command palette.

> [!note]
> While hint actions work in modals, standard navigation keys (like `j`/`k`) are suppressed to prevent interference with modal controls.

## Link handling

Internal links are navigated via Obsidian's link resolver, ensuring that "Open in new tab" settings and vault-relative paths are respected. External URLs (`http://` and `https://`) are opened in the system browser via `window.open()`.

In the editor (both Live Preview and Source mode), links are rendered as `<span>` elements without standard `href` attributes. The plugin resolves these links by converting the DOM element to a document position via CodeMirror's `posAtDOM()` API, then extracting the link target from the raw markdown text using regex matching. This works for all link types:

- `[[Target]]` — plain wikilinks
- `[[Target|Alias]]` — aliased wikilinks
- `[[Target#heading]]` — heading and block links
- `![[Target]]` — embed wikilinks
- `[text](Target)` — markdown links (internal)
- `[text](https://...)` — markdown links (external)
- `https://...` — bare URLs

Hint labels appear regardless of cursor position — both when the cursor is on the link's line (where links render as expanded `.cm-hmd-internal-link` or `.cm-link` spans) and when the cursor is elsewhere (where links render as collapsed `.cm-underline` spans). Source mode is fully supported.

In Reading view and frontmatter properties, links render as standard HTML elements with `href` or `data-href` attributes and are handled directly.

## Obsidian commands

The following commands are available in the Command Palette for custom hotkey assignment:

- `vim-motions-tparsons9:show-hint-labels`: Trigger standard hint mode.
- `vim-motions-tparsons9:hint-open-new-pane`: Trigger hint mode to open targets in a new pane.
- `vim-motions-tparsons9:hint-yank`: Trigger hint mode to yank link URLs or text.
- `vim-motions-tparsons9:hint-close`: Trigger hint mode to close tabs or panes.
- `vim-motions-tparsons9:hint-context-menu`: Trigger hint mode to open the context menu on a target.

## Configuration

Adjust hint mode behavior in **Settings → Vim Motions → Jump navigation**:

- **Hint characters**: The characters used for generating labels (default: home row).
- **Global hotkey**: Assign a hotkey to trigger hints from any context, including modals.
- **Font size**: Customize the size of the hint labels for better visibility.

> [!tip]
> Configure a **Global hotkey** in settings to allow triggering hint mode even when focus is inside a modal or a non-editor view that doesn't support standard Vim bindings.

> [!info]
> Hint mode fully supports popout windows. Labels will appear on elements within the active window.
