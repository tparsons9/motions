```bash
git clone https://github.com/saberzero1/motions.git
cd motions
npm install
npm run dev    # watch mode — rebuilds on file changes
```

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` to `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/vim-motions/` and reload Obsidian.

## Architecture

See [[architecture]] for the dual-vim architecture, module structure, and design patterns.

## Picker provider API

See [[picker-api]] for how external plugins can register custom picker sources via `window.VimMotions.picker`.

## Editor provider API

See [[editor-api]] for how external plugins attach Vim to editors they own, and provide hover, definition, quick fix, format and diagnostics to `gd`, `K`, `]d`/`[d` and `vim.lsp`.

## Full development guide

The comprehensive development guide — including testing strategy, Neovim golden comparison infrastructure, file conventions, and contribution guidelines — is maintained in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/saberzero1/motions/blob/main/AGENTS.md) in the repository root.

## codemirror-vim fork

Core vim behavior changes go in the [codemirror-vim fork](https://github.com/saberzero1/codemirror-vim) at `~/Repos/codemirror-vim`. The fork has its own test suite (1628 browser tests) and Neovim golden comparison infrastructure. See the fork's README for development instructions.

> [!warning] Dependency URL
> The `@replit/codemirror-vim` dependency in `package.json` must point to `https://github.com/saberzero1/codemirror-vim.git` (the remote URL) before committing. During local development, use `npm install ~/Repos/codemirror-vim` for fast iteration, but always switch back to the HTTPS URL before committing.
